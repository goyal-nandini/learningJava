ArrayDeque is short for Array Double-Ended Queue.
It lets you add or remove elements from both ends â€” front and rear.

âœ… Why use ArrayDeque?
Itâ€™s faster than LinkedList for stack/queue operations.

It's often used to implement:

A stack (like books piled up).

A queue (like a line).

The Deque interface inherits all the methods of the Queue interface â€”
and adds some extra methods of its own.
