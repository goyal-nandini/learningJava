✅ Does LinkedHashSet really extend HashSet?
Yes, technically:

public class LinkedHashSet<E> extends HashSet<E>

👇
But here's what it really means:

  @ HashSet uses a HashMap internally (just keys).

  @ "LinkedHashSet" uses a "LinkedHashMap" instead, which:

           @ Maintains insertion order using a "doubly linked list".

           @ Still ensures uniqueness (like all sets).

So, "LinkedHashSet" inherits all methods from "HashSet" (like add, clear, remove, etc.)
but adds the extra feature of maintaining insertion order.

🔍 Think of it like this:
Set = Interface (defines common behavior)

HashSet = Fast, unordered set

LinkedHashSet = Same as HashSet, but remembers the order in which things were added

✅ Analogy:
If HashSet is a plain box that ensures no duplicates, then LinkedHashSet is the
 same box but with a label on each item so you know in what order they were put in.

📌👇
now the question arises does LinkedHashSet directly implements Set??
ANS NO!!
LinkedHashSet does not directly implement the Set interface.
But it does behave like a Set, because it inherits all the necessary functionality

ACTUALLY
Set is implemented by AbstractSet

HashSet extends AbstractSet

LinkedHashSet extends HashSet

👇📍
  @  AbstractSet is an abstract class in Java.

  @  It provides a basic (partial) implementation of the Set interface.

  @  It saves time for developers: instead of implementing every method in Set
    from scratch, classes like HashSet and LinkedHashSet just extend AbstractSet
    and implement only the parts they need to customize.
