Very simple rule to remember:(in context with pattern 16 and former in nb)

Situation	Casting needed?	            Why?

Comparison  (<, >, <=, >=)	            ❌ No	Java auto-promotes types
                                        safely for comparison.
Assignment  (=)	                        ✅ Yes	Assignment needs matching
                                        types, else possible data loss.
