1️⃣You're noticing something very important — and yes, there's a **fundamental reason** why we don't
create objects like this for `Arrays` and `Collections`:

```java
// ✅ For ArrayList (we do this):
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

But for:

```java
Arrays arr = new Arrays();       // ❌ Not allowed
Collections col = new Collections(); // ❌ Not allowed
```

Java gives an error. Here's **why** 👇

---

## ✅ Arrays & Collections Are **Utility Classes**

### 🔹 What does that mean?

They are classes that only contain **static methods** (i.e., methods you can call without creating an object).

---

## 🔸 Why can’t we do `new Arrays()` or `new Collections()`?

Both `Arrays` and `Collections` have **private constructors**, which means:

> You **can’t create an object** of them using `new`.

They're not meant to be instantiated like `ArrayList` or `HashMap`.

---

### 📘 You just **use their static methods** like this:

```java
Arrays.sort(arr);
Collections.sort(list);
```

✔️ No need to write:

```java
Arrays arrays = new Arrays(); // ❌ Not allowed
```

---

## ✅ ArrayList, HashMap, etc. are **data structures** (not utility classes)

* You **create instances (objects)** of these because they actually store data.
* Example:

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
```

These are **real containers** that hold values.

---

## 🔑 Summary

| Class         | Is it instantiated with `new`? | Why?                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `ArrayList`   | ✅ Yes                          | It stores data; it's a data structure  |
| `HashMap`     | ✅ Yes                          | Same reason                            |
| `Arrays`      | ❌ No                           | Utility class with only static methods |
| `Collections` | ❌ No                           | Utility class with only static methods |

---

### 🧠 Tip to Remember:

> 🔧 If a class has only **static methods** and a **private constructor**, it’s a **utility class** — you **never need to create its object**.

2️⃣
You’re asking a **very sharp and fundamental** question — and you're absolutely right to think about this deeply.

Let’s clear the confusion:

---

## ✅ Yes, we write:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

And that makes people think:

> "So ArrayList comes from `java.util`, just like `Collections`... So why can I create `new ArrayList()` but not `new Collections()`?"

That’s where **the real difference** lies ⬇️

---

## 🔍 Here's the truth:

### 🔸 `java.util` is just a **package** — like a folder.

It contains **two types of classes**:

| Type                         | Examples                                     | Can you create objects?                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Data Structure classes** | `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `TreeMap` | ✔️ YES — you can do `new ArrayList()`                            |
| ❌ **Utility/helper classes** | `Arrays`, `Collections`                      | ❌ NO — only provide static methods, not meant to be instantiated |

---

### 🔹 So why the difference?

#### ✅ `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.

* These are **real classes** with state (they hold data).
* You **create objects** because you're building containers:

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
```

#### ❌ `Arrays`, `Collections`

* These are **utility/helper classes**.
* They don’t store data.
* All methods are `static`.
* Their **constructors are private**, so you can’t do `new Arrays()` or `new Collections()`.

---

### 🔑 Key Takeaway

> All of them come from the **`java.util` package**, but only **data structure classes** like `ArrayList` can be instantiated using `new`.
> Utility classes like `Arrays` and `Collections` are meant to provide **helper methods only**.

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy:

| Type                    | Like                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrayList`, `HashMap`  | Real containers you buy and fill with items                                                              |
| `Arrays`, `Collections` | Tools like scissors or glue — you don’t store things in them, just use them to work with your containers |
