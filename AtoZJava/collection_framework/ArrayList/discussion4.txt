In Java, the System.out.println() method can print any type of data, but it needs to
convert non-primitive data types (like objects) into a string format to print them.
For objects, Java automatically calls the toString() method to get a string representation
of the object.

when you pass an object to System.out.println() (or System.out.print()), the toString()
method of that object is automatically called to get the string representation of the
object.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

System.out.println(): This method prints out whatever is passed to it, followed by a new
line. If you pass a primitive type (like int, char, etc.), it will simply print it out.
But if you pass an object, it will call the object‚Äôs toString() method to convert the
object to a string.

"toString()" method: Every class in Java inherits the "toString()" method from the "Object"
class. The default "toString()" method in Object prints out the memory address of the object
(in a form like ClassName@hashcode). However, many classes "override" the "toString()" method
to provide a more meaningful string representation of the object.
