GENERIC CLASS:
a generic class allows you to write classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder
for the type of data they operate on. This is useful when you want to work with objects of
different types in a type-safe way. The <> symbols are used to specify the type parameters
for a generic class or method.

Why Use Generics?
Type Safety: The compiler checks types at compile time and prevents adding incompatible
types to collections, reducing runtime errors.

Eliminates Casting: Since the collection knows the type, you donâ€™t need to cast elements
when retrieving them.

Code Reusability: You can create one class or method and reuse it for different types,
 which keeps the code cleaner and more flexible.
