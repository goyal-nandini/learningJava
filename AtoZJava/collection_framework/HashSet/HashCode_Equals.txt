✅ Hash Code Concept:
sir said in vedio:
"Each element has a hash code, and because of this hash code,
it can't have duplicate elements."

You're almost correct, but let's refine this:

        Every object in Java has a hashCode() method.

        HashSet uses the hashCode() to determine where to place the object in
        memory (hash bucket).

        But just the hashCode() is not enough to guarantee uniqueness because
        different objects can have the same hash code (called a hash collision).

So, Java uses two steps to check duplicates:

        Check hashCode() — faster initial check.

        If hashCode matches, then check equals() — final check to ensure real equality.
