Collection → for single values (List, Set, etc.)

Map → for key-value pairs (Map<K, V>)

✅ HashMap implements Map.
So yes:

public class HashMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V>
But not:

HashMap does NOT implement Collection

✅A hashmap, also known as a hashtable, is a data structure that stores key-value
pairs, allowing for fast retrieval of values based on their keys.

✅A HashMap<K, V> in Java is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.

                Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
                map.put("Alice", 90);
                map.put("Bob", 80);

K = Key (e.g., String)
V = Value (e.g., Integer)
Keys must be unique.
Uses hashing to store and retrieve values quickly.
