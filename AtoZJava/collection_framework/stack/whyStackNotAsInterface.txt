ques was if there are stack methods then why stack not used as interface??

📌Why There’s No Stack Interface?
In Java, Stack was designed as a specific implementation of a collection that
follows the LIFO principle, and it wasn't necessary to define a Stack interface.
Instead, the Stack class itself provides its own methods that are specific to how a
stack works.

In contrast, collections like List, Queue, and Set are interfaces because they
represent generalized behaviors for different types of collections (array-based,
linked, unordered, etc.).

However, Stack is more specialized, so it directly provides methods like push(),
pop(), etc. within its class.

📌⭐👍
Stack Class (Not an Interface):
Stack is a class, not an interface.

Stack extends the Vector class (which is a List implementation).

Even though there's no Stack interface, Stack has its own specific methods because
it was designed to behave as a LIFO (Last In, First Out) collection.
