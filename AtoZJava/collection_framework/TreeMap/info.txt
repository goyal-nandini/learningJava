🔷 What is a TreeMap?
A TreeMap is a Map (key-value pairs) that:

    Stores elements in sorted order of keys (ascending by default).

    Does not allow null keys (unlike HashMap).📍

    Is based on Red-Black Tree (self-balancing BST) internally.

Basic Operations:
| Method           | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `put(k, v)`      | Adds key-value pair             |
| `get(k)`         | Returns value for the given key |
| `remove(k)`      | Removes key and its value       |
| `containsKey(k)` | Checks if a key exists          |
| `firstKey()`     | Returns the **smallest** key    |
| `lastKey()`      | Returns the **largest** key     |
| `higherKey(k)`   | Next higher key than given key  |
| `lowerKey(k)`    | Next lower key than given key   |

📍Great question! Let's focus just on this part:

 ## 🔴 Why TreeMap does not allow `null` keys**, but **HashMap allows one `null` key?

 ### ✅ In `HashMap`:

 HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
 map.put(null, "Hello");
 System.out.println(map);  // Output: {null=Hello}


 * `HashMap` uses **hashing** to store keys.
 * For `null`, it has pecial handling internally, so it **accepts one `null` key**.

 ### ❌ In `TreeMap`:

 TreeMap<String, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
 map.put(null, "Hello"); // 🚫 Throws NullPointerException!

 * `TreeMap` uses a **Red-Black Tree** to store keys in **sorted order**.
 * To sort, it compares keys using:

   *`compareTo() (if natural order)
   * Or a custom Comparator

 ➡️ But if the key is `null`, it **can’t be compared**, so Java throws:


 NullPointerException

 ### 🧠 In short:

 | Map Type  | Allows `null` key? | Why?                                                |
 | --------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
 | `HashMap` | ✅ Yes (one only)   | Uses hashing, handles `null`                        |
 | `TreeMap` | ❌ No               | Needs to **compare** keys, `null` can't be compared |


 ### 💡 Analogy:

 * `HashMap` just needs a label to store something. Even if it's `null`, it can say: “Okay, I’ll handle this.”
 * `TreeMap` needs to sort those labels. But how can it sort something that’s missing? (`null`) ❌
