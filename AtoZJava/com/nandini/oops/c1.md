# 🌟 **FINAL vs FINALLY vs FINALIZE**

These three are often confusing, so let’s cleanly separate them:

## 🏁 1. `final` (Keyword)**

Used for **restriction**.

| Used with    | Meaning                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| **variable** | value cannot be changed |
| **method**   | cannot be overridden    |
| **class**    | cannot be inherited     |

### Example

```java
final int x = 10;
// x = 20; // ❌ error
```

```java
final class A {}
class B extends A {} // ❌ cannot extend
```

```java
class A {
    final void show() {}
}
class B extends A {
    void show() {} // ❌ cannot override
}
```

---

## 🧹 2️. `finally` (Block)**

Used in **exception handling**.
The code inside `finally` **always executes**, whether an exception occurs or not.

### Example

```java
try {
    System.out.println(10/0);
} catch(Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error");
} finally {
    System.out.println("I will always execute");
}
```

### 💡 Is `finally` deprecated?

❌ **NO.** `finally` is NOT deprecated.
Your instructor likely referred to **`finalize()`**, not `finally`.

---

## 🗑️ 3. `finalize()` (Method)**

This is a method used by Garbage Collector before destroying an object.

### But — is it deprecated?

✅ **YES — deprecated since Java 9**
Reason: it was unpredictable and unsafe, sometimes not called at all.

### Example (Old usage)

```java
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("object destroyed");
}
```

### Replacement

Use `Cleaner` or `try-with-resources`

# 🧠 Garbage Collection mini-summary

* Java automatically frees memory
* You **cannot predict** when GC runs
* `System.gc()` only suggests, does not force

| Concept                            | Why it matters                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **final**                          | restrictions + immutability     |
| **Wrapper & Integer immutability** | explains swap behavior, caching |
| **Pass by value**                  | explains object references      |
| **Garbage collection & finalize**  | memory management               |
| **finally block**                  | safe cleanup                    |
