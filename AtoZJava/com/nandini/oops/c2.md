##  **The meaning of the statement**

**“The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int in an object. An object of type Integer contains a single field whose type is int.”**

### It means:

### 🔹 `Integer` is a class

and

### 🔹 It stores **one primitive `int` value inside it**

So an `Integer` object is like a **box** that contains a primitive `int` inside.

---

###  Visual understanding

```
Integer obj = 10;
```

Internally becomes:

```
obj ----> [ value : 10 ]
```

Where **value** is a field (variable) inside the `Integer` class:

```java
class Integer {
    private final int value;  // this is the single field mentioned
}
```

So the line simply means:

👉 **Integer = Object**
👉 **int = Primitive**
👉 **Integer stores an int inside itself**

Or in one short sentence:

> **Integer is just a container that holds a primitive int inside it.**

---

##  Why do we need this?

Because **objects** can:

* be used in `ArrayList`, HashMap, etc.
* have methods
* store null
* be passed where objects are required

Primitive `int` cannot do these.

##  One ultra-simple example

```java
int a = 5;             // primitive
Integer b = 5;         // object containing 5
```

Memory:

```
a = 5                (stored directly in stack)
b -> [value = 5]     (object stored in heap)
```

---

##  Final takeaway sentence

> **Integer is a wrapper around the primitive int — it wraps the int inside an object so it can behave like an object.**
