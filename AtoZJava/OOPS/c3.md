BACKGROUND: i got really confused about how "int" is there in "Integer"
also in the vedio there is final keyword discussion,
(in oops1 instructor(kunal) turned on "final" keyword with Integer class source code
so here is what from docs and chatbot, easy clarification i got...!! :)

#  **Where `int` appears inside the Integer class**

Inside the source code of **`Integer` class**, you will see something like:

```java
public final class Integer {
    private final int value;   // <-- this is 'int', primitive
}
```

### ✔ What does this mean?

* `Integer` **is a class** (wrapper class)
* Inside it, there is a field named `value`
* This `value` stores the **actual integer number**, but in **primitive `int` form**

So when you write:

```java
Integer a = 10;
```

Internally it stores:

```
a -> reference -> object on heap
object contains:
    value = 10 (primitive int)
```

---

#  Why we talk about `int` inside Integer?

Because:

* `Integer` **wraps** a primitive value
* `Integer` objects store data using a primitive `int`

### **So we talk about Integer (object) externally**

but

### **Internally it holds an `int` value**

Example difference:

| Code             | Stored where                                           | Type                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `int x = 10`     | directly in stack                                      | primitive                                 |
| `Integer y = 10` | reference in stack, actual value stored in heap object | wrapper object containing primitive `int` |

#  Why was `final` shown by the instructor?

Inside Integer class:

```java
private final int value;
```

### Meaning:

* Once the integer object is created, its internal value **cannot change**
* That’s why `Integer` is **immutable**
* And that is why swapping does not work

Because when we do:

```java
static void swap(Integer a, Integer b) {
    Integer temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

We are only changing the **local copies of references**, not the original ones.

And since `Integer`'s internal `value` is **final**, we cannot modify it either.

---

#  So final clarification in one line:

> **Integer is a class that creates immutable objects which internally store a primitive `int` value in the field `final int value`.**

That’s why:

* Integer is a class
* Integer objects are objects containing int
* Reference is passed by value
* Swap cannot change original variables
