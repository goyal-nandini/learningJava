// A NEW WAY
//Euclid's method for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers consists of
// replacing the larger number with the difference of the numbers, and repeating this until the two numbers are equal:
// that is their greatest common divisor.(USED IN THE FOLLOWING CODE)

//The method introduced by Euclid for computing greatest common divisors is based on the fact that,
// given two positive integers a and b such that a > b, the common divisors of a and b are the same as the
// common divisors of a â€“ b and b.
